Updated version of the basic cordic algorithm
To start a simulation in ModelSim:
1) generate the code using the Jupyter Notebook "Basic_CORDIC.ipynb"
2) set the number of bit for the input angle, the number of iterations a the test angle expressed in radians
3) save the vhdl codes both for the basic Cordic and the testbench
4) open the vhdl files for the: a) basic cordic, b) testbench, c) clock generator
5) compile them and run the simulation


ALTERNATIVE BETTER WAY:

create the basic cordic with "python3 create_BC.py [number of bits] [number of rotations]"
