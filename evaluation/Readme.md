EVALUATION of the cordic algorithms.


To run the evaluation of the FPAX algorithm type:

./evalFpax.sh

To run the evluation of the PARA cordic algorithm type:

./evalPara.sh

To run the evaluation of the basic cordic algorithm type:

./evalBasicCordic.sh



The scripts build and run the  algorithms for all available Bitlengths and for different input angles. It will then calcualte the errors to the real sin/cos values for the input angles and produce a output file with the results
