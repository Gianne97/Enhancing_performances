EVALUATION of the cordic algorithms.

So far only the evaluation of the fpax is implemented.

To run the evaluation type:

./evaluate.sh


This script builds and runs the cordic algorithms for all available Bitlengths and for different input angles. It will then calcualte the errors to the real sin/cos values for the input angles and plot them.
